Chat server and client written in Go (simple prototype for learning purposes). The application utilizes goroutines and channels.

### Usage

```bash
# Build and start container:
docker compose up -d
# Enter go-cli-chat container:
docker exec -it go-cli-chat bash
# Run chat server within go-cli-chat container:
go-cli-chat-server
# Open another go-cli-chat container and start client:

You can also make changes and rebuild either `client` or `server` by using:

```
